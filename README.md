# Cross-Market-Financial-Models-2020-2030
This repository contains the complete analytical model used for my cross-market corporate research comparing India and the United States across 11 major sectors. The financial model integrates ROCE-PE analysis, fundamental scorecards, sector heatmaps, risk-return maps, Risk-Adjusted Performance Index, Composite Attractiveness Score models for both economies.
This repo serves as a transparent, structured view of the analytical backbone used in my research paper "Decoding India and US Corporate Landscape: Cross-Sector Fundamentals and Outlook to 2030".
